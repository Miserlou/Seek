# seek

Display internet search results without ever leaving your terminal. Oh, and it can speed read the results as well. Basically, it's command line nirvana.

Seek is a sister to [howdoi](https://github.com/gleitz/howdoi/) and [Glance](https://github.com/Miserlou/glance/).

## Installation

    pip install seek

## Examples

    $ seek a nice up of tea orwell 

    If you look up 'tea' in the first cookery book that comes to hand you will probably find that it is unmentioned; or at most you will find a few lines of sketchy instructions which give no ruling on several of the most important points. [etc.]
